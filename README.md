AI & ML Internship – Task 1
## Understanding Dataset & Data Types
## Task Objective

The objective of this task is to understand the structure of a dataset, identify different data types, analyze data quality, and evaluate its suitability for machine learning. This task focuses on exploratory data analysis using Python and Pandas without building any ML model.

## Dataset Used

Students Performance Dataset

Source: Kaggle – Students Performance in Exams

Format: CSV

Total Records: 1000

Total Features: 8

The dataset contains students’ academic scores along with demographic and educational background information.

## Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Jupyter Notebook 

## Files in This Repository

StudentsPerformance_dataset.csv – Dataset used for analysis

students_performance_code.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook with full analysis

README.md – Task explanation and summary

## Task Steps Performed

Loaded the dataset using Pandas and displayed the first and last few records

Identified numerical, categorical, binary, and ordinal features

Used df.info() and df.describe() to understand data types and statistics

Checked unique values in categorical columns

Identified the target variable and input features

Analyzed dataset size and ML suitability

Observed data quality issues such as missing values and imbalance

## Key Observations

The dataset contains both numerical and categorical features

No missing values were found

Exam scores are numerical and suitable for regression tasks

Categorical features have limited and meaningful classes

Dataset size is sufficient for basic machine learning models

## Target Variable

Math Score

## Input Features

Gender

Race/Ethnicity

Parental Level of Education

Lunch Type

Test Preparation Course

Reading Score

Writing Score

## Conclusion

The Students Performance Dataset is clean, well-structured, and suitable for machine learning applications. This task helped in understanding data types, dataset structure, and ML readiness, fulfilling all objectives of Task 1 in the AI & ML internship.
